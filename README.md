# Calculator
This project is a simple web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes standard calculator functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator displays the current and previous operand, supports keyboard input, and shows an error message when dividing by zero. The design is responsive and styled using a custom grid layout.

Features:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Decimal point and reset functionality
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., divide by zero)
- Keyboard support for number and operation keys
